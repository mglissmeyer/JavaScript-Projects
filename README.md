# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of assignments that demonstrate my skills in JavaScript web development.

## Projects

### 1. Pizza Menu

The Pizza Menu project challenged me to create a dynamic menu for ordering pizzas. It offers a range of toppings and sizes for users to customize their pizza. The application calculates the total cost based on the user's selections.

### 2. Tic Tac Toe

In the Tic Tac Toe project, I developed a classic game where users can play against the computer. It's a fun and interactive way to test your strategic skills and compete against an AI opponent.

### 3. Calculator

The Calculator project involved building a simple yet functional 4-function calculator. Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease. It's a handy tool for quick calculations.
