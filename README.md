# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of assignments that showcase my skills in JavaScript web development.

## Projects

### 1. Pizza Menu

The **Pizza Menu** project challenged me to create a dynamic menu for ordering pizzas. Users can customize their pizza with various toppings and sizes, and the application calculates the total cost based on their selections.

### 2. Tic Tac Toe

In the **Tic Tac Toe** project, I developed a classic game where users can play against the computer. It's an engaging way to test your strategic skills and compete against an AI opponent.

### 3. Calculator

The **Calculator** project involved building a simple yet functional 4-function calculator. Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease. It's a handy tool for quick calculations.
