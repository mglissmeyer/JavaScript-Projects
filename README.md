### Pizza Menu

This project had me create a pizza menu with various toppings and sizes. It would then calculate your total based on what you selected.

### Tic Tac Toe

I created a tic tac toe game that had the user play against the computer.

### Calculator

This was a basic 4 function calculator that users could add, subtract, multiply, and divide with.
